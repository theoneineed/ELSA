# ELSA
ELSA Project

ELSA is an offline shopping doftware which implements various object oriented ideas, and the software was written using UML.

This project was done by me as a part of my semester long project while I took CSE 1325 (Object Oriented Program).
I learned to build software in a way it is done in the industry during my time in the class.
I learned about scrums, workflow, git, and many more during my time taking this course.

I am posting this here to showcase what I learned during my time I took the course and strictly forbid anyone copying the code for their own assignments.
Cheers!
